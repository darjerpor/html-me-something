		<h2>A Brief Rambling of My Journey</h2>
		
		
		<h3>How It Began</h3>
		<p>I was born and raised in St.Louis and spent most of my life here. 
		Since I was young I knew that I wanted to work with computers for my career.
		There was a time that I was taking computers apart and putting them back together 
		for fun at the age of 3. I was always told I was a "gifted" child. Though I liked to 
		outside and play, ride bikes, explore the neighborhood (back when it wasn't so terrifying)
		I still liked to study computers and keep up with emerging technology. I learned a few
		hacking techniques, I learned about viruses and other malware, I learned a little html and css, 
		as well as made some simple flash games all by the age of 10. At one point, my goal was to 
		become another company similar to AMD or Intel. </p>

		<h3>Getting More In Depth</h3>
		<p>I joined the Army Reserves while still in high school. After coming back from 
		Basic Training I went to college at Northwest Missouri State University to study
		Computer Science. After four years I was struggling financially so I decided to come back to St.Louis
		and study Computer Science at the Univeristy of Missouri - St.Louis while working at 
		QuikTrip. After transferring I realized to finish the Computer Science degree at UMSL I would 
		need to go to school another two years. But I wanted to break into the tech world as soon
		as possible! So I decided to take a shorter degree in Information Technology. Then I saw it would
		still take me about a year and a half. So then I decided to get my Associates in Applied Science
		in Network Engineering!</p>

		<h3>Where I Am Now</h3>
		<p>During my last year at NWMSU in the 2016-2017, I got into Network Security! Even though I 
		am taking this course to learn web development skills, I am also finishing my AAS in Network Engineering.
		I figured until I get a job as a web dev then I can do something else I enjoy as well. I am glad 
		I found LaunchCode. Even though I have the knowledge and skills to code websites I don't get any luck due to
		not having a degree. Which is why I have been delving into the world of Network Engineering and Security
		Security is a highly intriguing topic to me. Whether it be security for the network or security for software, I want
		to learn it all! I am expected to graduate from St.Louis Community College in Spring 2020. Once I am done
		getting my AAS, I will continue on to UMSL to finish my degree in Computing Technology!
